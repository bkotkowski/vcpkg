     #   ( Let's suppose $w is an instance of the scrodget widget .. )
    $w westScroll configure -width 10
     # change the "padding" space around the frame.
    $w frame configure -padx 10 -pady 10      
    
* BINDINGS
   .. bindings should be set as usual for the 'associated' widget,
   ..  not for the scrodget

   Example:
     # On click, print canvas coordinates ...
     scrodget .mc
     .mc associate [canvas .c]
     bind .c  <Button-1> { puts "X:[%W canvasx %x] Y:[%W canvasy %y]" }

* EXAMPLE *

  package require scrodget
  scrodget .mc -autohide true
  .mc associate [canvas .c]
   .c configure -scrollregion { -100 -100 100 100 }
   .c configure -bd 5 -relief sunken
  .mc configure -scrollsides ew
   # note that you should not directly 'pack' the canvas.
  pack .mc -fill both -expand true
  .c create line -90 -90 90 90 
  bind .c <Button-1> { puts "X:[%W canvasx %x] Y:[%W canvasy %y]" }

   0  false  no  off .. plus any abbreviation, case insensitive (deprecated)

** Notes about 'destroying' scrodgets **

   ** Just to confirm the standard Tk mechanism **
   
   Q: What happens to associated widgets a scrodget is destroyed ?
   A: it depends on the hierarchical relationship between the scrodget and 
      its associated widget.
      If associated-widget is a descendant of scrodget,
       when scrodget is destroyed, all its descendant are destroyed.
       ** Example :
       scrodget .mc
       .mc associate [canvas .mc.cvs -bg red]
       pack .mc
       destroy .mc
       # note that canvas has been destroyed
      If associated-widget is not a descendant of scrodget, 
       when the scrodget is destroyed, it is not destroyed 
       (of course it disappears from the screen).
       ** Example :
       scrodget .mc
       .mc associate [canvas .mycvs -bg red]
       pack .mc
       destroy .mc
       # note that canvas .mycvs still exists !
