Meta description  Kettle is a system to make building Tcl packages quick
Meta description  and easy. More importantly, possibly, to make writing
Meta description  the build system for Tcl packages easy. As such kettle
Meta description  is several things: (1) A DSL helping you to write build
Meta description  systems for your packages. (2) A package implementing
Meta description  this DSL. (3) An application which can serve as the
Meta description  interpreter for a build file containing commands in the
Meta description  above DSL.
